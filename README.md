Song Wars

May The Tunes Be with You!!

Song Wars is a clone of the Spotify Web Player.

I used PHP and SQL for queries and HTML, CSS and Javascript for front-end. All the albums and artist names are displayed using sql queries.
I have added the database in the include folder. 
You don't need to create a database, simply fork the repository, clone it on your machine and go to include/database/slotify.sql, however
you will need XAMPP to run the app. 
The slotify.sql contains the tables for Albums, artists, Songs and Users.
The users table uses md8 encryption to store the password.

I created Song Wars with the help of a course on Udemy. The link to the course is attached below.
