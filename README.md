I used PHP and SQL for queries and HTML, CSS and Javascript for front-end. All the albums and artist names are displayed using sql queries.

## Installation

- The include folder contains the database required. 
- You don't need to create a database, simply fork the repository, clone it on your machine and go to include/database/slotify.sql, however you will need XAMPP to run the app. 
- The slotify.sql contains the tables for Albums, artists, Songs and Users.

I created Song Wars with the help of a course on Udemy. The link to the course is attached below.
